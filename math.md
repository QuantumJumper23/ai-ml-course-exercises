We use a theorem called Bayes theroem which is used to calculate the probability of 
an event happening given prior knowledge.
example **P(A|B)=P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)**
P(A|B)= probability of even A given that B alreadyhappened.
in the titanic case probability of survivability given that they are female ,hascabin etc

**P(Survived∣Sex, Age, Pclass, Fare, HasCabin)= P(Sex, Age, Pclass, Fare, HasCabin∣Survived)⋅P(Survived)/P(Sex,Age,Pclass,Fare,HasCabin)**
